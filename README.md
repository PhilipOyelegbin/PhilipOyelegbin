### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Philip Oyelegbin a graduate of Industrial Maintenance Engineering from Yaba College of Technology. My transition to tech started in 2020 during COVID-19 through my lecturer Dr Samson Oloketuyi who introduced me to programming. I have exposed myself to various aspect of tech ranging from desktop app development using Tkinter and PyQt, frontend web development using (HTML, CSS - {SCSS, Bootstrap and Tailwind} and JavaScript), backend web development using Flask a python framework, UI/UX design using Figma, data science using Python, networking using Cisco Packet Traser and artificial intelligence using Python. Yes, you can say I am a lover of python ðŸ˜‡

I decided to major in frontend engineering after the journey of exposure which has been instrumental on my decision making. Therefore, focused on providing website development solutions like:
* Landing page
* School portal
* Hospital health management system
* E-commerce website
* Domain registration
* Website hosting, and more
